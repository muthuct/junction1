    <!-- Code Snippet for delayed page load :
         Code Snippet to load page after all resources have been loaded
         We are using an element to hide all elements and once the page loads required resources we stop displaying '#hideAll' element. We do this by giving a 0.5s delay after page load and then set #hideAll's display as none and then set the animation for the welcome text by adding animate.css classes-->
         <div style="display: none" id="hideAll">&nbsp;</div>
         <script>
             document.getElementById("hideAll").style.display = "block";
             window.onload = function () {
                 setTimeout(loadPage, 500);
             }
     
             function loadPage() {
                 document.getElementById("hideAll").style.display = "none";
                 $('#welcome').show().addClass('animated fadeInUpBig');
